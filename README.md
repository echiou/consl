consl
=====

A better way to interface with your car. Rather than having an insane amount of buttons and dials, which can be confusing, or a touchscreen, a la Tesla or Apple, which can be difficult to use and dangerous, we have distilled the center console to its bare minimums. We feel that all features of a car can be accessed through a dial and four buttons (among other miscellaneous features not shown here). NOTE: the web app must be used with its associated input device, which we made from an Arduino and breadboard.

A demo (which requires the relevant input device), can be found at echiou.github.io/consl.
